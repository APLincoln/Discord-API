# Discord-API

This is a repo where I will be testing the Discord API to look into creating a moderation bot. This will control the application you have created in the Discord Developer Portal using your Bot Token.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- You have created a bot through the discord developer portal
- You have given the bot all message privileges and message content privileges.
- You have added your bot to your channel using the generated link.

## Steps

1) Using the sample provided in the app folder populate a .env file.
2) Run the main file locally. You should see a message in the console stating that the bot is running. You can validate this by checking if the bot is online in your discord server.
3) Send a message in the server and it should respond with the message content that you sent
